                    <h1><a href="https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1454218925483384834" target="_blank">OG Thread by @divine_economy - Oct 30, 2021</a></h1>

                    <h2><br>Recently, i've been imagining how web3 could transform everyday institutions:<br>

                        <br>— homes<br>
                        <br>— bars<br>
                        <br>— galleries<br>
                        <br>— sports<br>
                        <br>— college<br>
                        <br>— book club<br>
                        <br>— venture<br>
                        <br>— credit cards<br>
                        <br>— discord<br>
                        <br>— facebook<br>
                        <br>— quora<br>
                        <br>— onlyfans<br>
                        <br>— disney<br>
                        
                        <br>but each reveals a fundamental principle of what web3 means.<br>
                        
                        <br>Web3 is about turning expenses into investments. A web3 home would let you pay rent as a partial investment in ownership, and rent itself 
                        could be auctioned as a utility nft based on demand. <a href="https://www.creatorcabins.com/" target="_blank">Creator Cabins</a> could make this happen.<br>
                        <br>Web3 home:<br>
                        <br>— renting is an investment to co-own house<br>
                        <br>— enables home coownership for those w little $$<br>
                        <br>— token-swap w protocols/communities looking for retreat<br>
                        <br>— support artists to create w commission on future work<br>
                        <br>— auction time at home using nfts w cut on resales<br>
                        <br>— many dogs<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about value going to those who create it. at a web3 bar, the musicians, poets, and—sure—ladies on ladies night would capture the 
                        value they generate. And again, membership becomes an investment. See <a href="https://twitter.com/j_asminewang">Jasmine Wang</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 bar:<br>
                        <br>— pay in $BAR<br>
                        <br>— profit distributed to $BAR hodlers as staking apy<br>
                        <br>— own 100 $BAR and drink free<br>
                        <br>— smart contracts give artists cut of revenue for readings/performances<br>
                        <br>— other DAOs can pay in native tokens for parties, exhibitions, book clubs<br>
                        <br>— lots of books and plants<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about the power of collective ownership. A Web3 gallery would be owned by artists who promote each other.
                        Their NFTs would be badges of philanthropic giving and tickets to events—further increasing value. 
                        We're building this at <a href="https://eco.mirror.xyz/" target="_blank">Ecodao</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 gallery:<br>
                        <br>— artist dao<br>
                        <br>— $$ split between artist, charity, dao<br>
                        <br>— nfts let collectors into dao and exclusive events<br>
                        <br>— so nfts are art, tickets to community, badges of giving<br>
                        <br>— artists invest dao funds for parties, residences, or interest-as-UBI<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about community governance. A Web3 sports team would be owned by fans, who would make decisions about drafts and trades — and make bets with other teams by staking tokens.
                        Watch <a href="https://krausehouse.club/" target="_blank">The Krause House</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 miami heat:<br>
                        <br>— owned by fans<br>
                        <br>— tokens used to decide draft and trades—and bet on games<br>
                        <br>— esports leagues use nfts of players w portion of winnings going to player and team<br>
                        <br>— anyone can build games/worlds around nfts and take cut of transactions<br>
                        <br>— nft merch drops<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about credentialing your work rather than your background. Harvard gives 10x preference to legacies. A web3 harvard gives none,
                        instead it records your work, its impact, its peer-review—so you can get paid for it. Watch <a href="https://rabbithole.gg/">RabbitHole 🐇🕳️</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 Harvard:<br>
                        <br>— free syllabi and lectures<br>
                        <br>— students complete assignments to earn points<br>
                        <br>— peer assessors also earn points for awarding nft prizes<br>
                        <br>— points + nfts earn tokens from protocols w extra apy for signing job contract<br>
                        <br>— so protocols pay to recruit students<br>
                        <br>— bye harvard<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about learn-to-earn—so that anyone can pursue education, can work, can work *in meaningful ways*. A Web3 book club lets 
                        people learn web3 by taking classes through DAOs and participating in DAOs—and getting paid for it.<br>
                        <br>Web3 book club:<br>
                        <br>— lets you create public/open-source syllabi, lectures, podcast discussions<br>
                        <br>— any DAO can use these to build community, generate insights<br>
                        <br>— readers can find DAO book clubs through marketplace<br>
                        <br>— DAOs pays readers for completing book club<br>
                        <br>— you get cut of pay<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about permissionless participation. A Web3 VC fund wouldn't limit itself to helping rich investors get richer.
                        It would let anyone invest up to a certain amount—giving anyone a stake in companies they'd be incentivized to support.<br>
                        <br>Web3 a16z:<br>
                        <br>— lets anyone invest as LP on-chain, so not only rich can make $$<br>
                        <br>— replaces carry with membership tokens that scale with LP check size<br>
                        <br>— run as a DAO, partners get tokens proportionate to work<br>
                        <br>— gives LPs incentives to build out protocols<br>
                        <br>— open-source to replicate<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about UBI. I don't mean money companies print for themselves and hope hold value (see: worldcoin). I mean user-owned communities 
                        redistributing revenue and interest. This is how a community-owned, web3 visa could out-bribe credit cards.<br>
                        <br>Web3 Visa:<br>
                        <br>— businesses choose fee: 1%, 2% repaid over time, 3% repaid with interest<br>
                        <br>— fees invested in <a href="https://app.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> / <a href="https://gov.yearn.finance/">yearn.finance</a> / <a href="https://app.anchorprotocol.com/">Anchor Protocol</a><br>
                        <br>— interest repays businesses (above)<br>
                        <br>— additional interest paid out to users as web3 credit card<br>
                        <br>so notes:<br>
                        <br>credit cards are bribe-based: charge businesses high fees and pay part of those to users to bribe them into using your credit card. 
                        they're perfect web2 marketplaces that know that capturing the consumer will force the business to acquiesce to their terms.
                        but credit cards have to bribe users bc they're competing with *each* other to handle users' money. compete to be financial rails, but it's the *business* 
                        that needs to be bribed to accept payment. still, users need rewards or they'll use credit cards.
                        so a crypto version of visa/mastercard can:<br>

                        <br>1) charge businesses less than credit cards (1% instead of 2.9%)<br>
                        <br>2) charge less and *repay* the fee over time<br>
                        <br>3) charge the same but repay and *earn* money for businesses over time<br>

                        <br>meanwhile, rest of interest serves as cc points.<br>
                        <br>defi makes this possible with incredible interest rates as users pour into the system. will it last? hopefully. but if not, a web3 visa would onboard half 
                        the world's businesses while defi aligns incentives on all sides to the benefit of everyone. disintermediating credit cards isn't particularly sexy or exciting 
                        work—it involves a lot of manual onboarding, education for businesses, and probably a good deal of hardware. but in some ways, it's the most vital work we can do to bring the world on-chain.<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about gamifying community with incentives. Discord fails because we feel penalized for missing discussion. A Web3 discord would reward us 
                        instead—letting us stake tokens and earn rewards for contributions & collaboration. Watch <a href="https://www.guild.xyz/">Guild</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 Discord:<br>
                        <br>— built in token gating, rewards, and voting<br>
                        <br>— staking and yield farming—possible to work for protocols<br> 
                        <br>— monetized by in-app bounties and rewards<br>
                        <br>— owned and operated by people who use it<br>
                        <br> — functional dm and bleeping-sound controls<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about owning our data. A Web3 facebook would let *us* monetize from our data because we own it. We can then share or hide it across platforms. 
                        Sovereign data is the next step after sovereign finance. Watch <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 Facebook:<br>
                        <br>— conversation platform for events/topics/activities<br>
                        <br>— no monologues<br>
                        <br>— groups can merge or split fractally<br>
                        <br>— if member proposes CTA, group can become DAO w/options for treasury and governance<br>
                        <br>— users can share data to get recs on groups and earn share of ad money<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about getting creators paid *while* ensuring their creations are free & open-source. NFTs are one way of doing this. Crowdfunding is another.
                        A Web3 quora lets users fund responses that are free forever. Watch <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a> and <a href="https://mirror.xyz/">Mirror</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 quora:<br>
                        <br>— get points for each upvote on your response<br>
                        <br>— points pay you tokens that grow exponentially with upvotes per day<br>
                        <br>— tokens can be paid to creators if they answer specific questions<br>

                        <br>Web3 is about capturing consumer surplus to maximize value for creators. A Web3 OnlyFans lets creators release redeemable NFTs 
                        for acts they're willing to perform—and capture full value from auctions and resales. Watch <a href="https://nftreats.art/">nftreats</a><br>
                        <br>Web3 OnlyFans:<br>
                        <br>— creators earn tokens for protocol by selling NFTs<br>
                        <br>— nfts specify acts they're willing to perform<br>
                        <br>— nfts can be redeemed for performance or sold on exchange<br>
                        <br>— holding full nft collection in wallet enables membership benefits (to limit liquidity)<br>

                        <br>And Web3 is about decentralization. Specifically, decentralized creation. A Web3 disney is crowd-sourced, crowd-built, crowd-credentialed, and crowd-funded.
                        And creators get paid whenever anyone monetizes their creation. Watch <a href="https://www.fwb.help/">Friends With Benefits</a><br> 
                        <br>Web3 Disney:<br>
                        <br>— tool to create nfts of characters, music, etc.<br>
                        <br>— anyone can mint, use, and combine them to make stories & games<br>
                        <br>— good stories have network effects: fans build them out and share<br>
                        <br>— "canon" determined by fan engagement<br>
                        <br>— if work is monetized, all creators get a cut<br>
