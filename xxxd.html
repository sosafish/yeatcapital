                    <h3>After months of work and the collaborative effort of about a dozen contributors, we're excited to introduce Primitive's RMM-01: replicating covered calls with CFMM shares! Partying face

                        <br>A direct extension of the work of RMMs <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14769.pdf" target="_blank">Replicating Market Makers</a> by

                        <a href="https://twitter.com/tarunchitra" target="_blank">Tarun Chitra</a>, we implement a CFMM whose 
                        liquidity shares probabilistically replicate the payoff of a Black-Scholes covered call.<br> 
                        <br>First off, why approach covered calls this way?? The key advantages are:<br>
                        <br>1. Premiums w/o the need for counterparties<br>
                        <br>2.No oracles<br>
                        <br>3.Composable DeFi primitive<br>
                        <br>4.Any token pair<br>
                        <br>5.Deep liquidity concentration in at-the-money pools<br>
                        <br>The ability to sell calls and collect premiums without the need for a counterparty is ensured simply through 
                        the swap fee of the AMM. This is probabilistic but can be optimized to capture more revenue. You'll never need to deal with this guy.<br>
                        <br>Another more subtle implication: pools nearer to their strike and expiry exhibit much deeper concentration of liquidity, making swaps more efficient.
                        By shorting LP tokens and paying a premium, you can obtain the same payoff as buying an option. Closing the position is as simple as re-minting and returning the LP tokens.<br>

                        <br><img src="media/xxxd/1.jpg" width="90%"><br>

                        <br>Alternatively, skip the shorting entirely and go long cash-or-nothing calls or asset-or-nothing puts just by paying a premium.  Same curve different payoffs.
                        These are just two examples of potentially many options-like payoffs that can be derived from RMM-01.  Each approach comes with a distinct set of tradeoffs 
                        and we're actively exploring the design space for payoffs that provide the most flexibility.<br>

                        <br>We've had a ton of fun exploring these topics over the past months and we're super excited to share the results of our efforts with the greater defi community.<br>
